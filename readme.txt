The Geolocation plugin allows WordPress users to geotag their posts using the Edit Post page or any geo-enabled WordPress mobile applications.

== Description ==

The Geolocation plugin allows WordPress users to geotag their posts using the Edit Post page or any geo-enabled WordPress mobile applications such as WordPress for iPhone, WordPress for Android, or WordPress for BlackBerry.

Visitors see a short description of the address either before, after, or at a custom location within the post. Hovering over the address reveals a map that displays the post's exact location.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `geolocation` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Modify the display settings as needed on the Settings > Geolocation page.
